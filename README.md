# Password-complexity-checker
PRODIGY_CS_03
A password strength assessment tool evaluates how secure a password is by analyzing it against several key criteria, including:

Length: Longer passwords tend to be more secure as they increase the difficulty of brute-force attacks.

Character diversity: It checks for the inclusion of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters, since a mix of these increases complexity.

Complexity and unpredictability: Passwords that appear random and do not follow common patterns are rated stronger.

Feedback and scoring: The tool assigns a score based on how many criteria the password meets and categorizes it, typically as "Weak," "Medium," "Strong," or "Very Strong."

User guidance: It offers specific suggestions such as increasing length, adding uppercase letters, numbers, or special characters to improve the password's strength.

Educational component: By providing detailed feedback, the tool helps users understand what makes a password strong and encourages better password practices.

Typically, such a tool can be implemented with regex-based checks for character types and assessing length, combined with a scoring system to rate the password strength and generate actionable feedback. This helps users create stronger and more secure passwords, reducing vulnerability to cyberattacks
